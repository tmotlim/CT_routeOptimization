# CT_routeOptimization

**The context **

A delivery company receives multiple orders which need to be scheduled. Each order includes the 
following information: order ID and target location (in 2D coordinates). The delivery trucks must 
start and end at the company (which is at (0, 0)). All the items to be delivered are stored at the 
company in the beginning. The company has a limited number of trucks. All trucks are identical, 
and the speed of each truck is 1 length unit per time unit. Each truck can deliver more than one
order at a time.

**Created a route optimization algorithm to optimize**

Used K-means clustering and Randomized nearest neighbour, with two-opt
